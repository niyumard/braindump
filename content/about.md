## What is this place? {#what-is-this-place}

This place is where I share my [org-roam](https://orgroam.com) notes and publish them via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). If you don't know about Org-Roam and are an academic, please make sure that you educate yourself about it. Feel free to improve my notes by sending PRs to the Github repository.
